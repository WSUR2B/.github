The Rehab Robotics and Biomechanics (R2B) Laboratory aims to develop and test new robotic devices and therapies to help persons with disability due to neurological and orthopedic injuries. Specifically, we seek to create unique electro-mechanical mechanisms to retrain an individualâ€™s lost abilities or augment existing ones. We strive to design systems that tap into the principles of movement biomechanics, motor control and learning, and neuroplasticity. Research on these topics includes basic design and manufacturing, benchtop analysis, neuromusculoskeletal modeling, and translational studies in human subjects, where we evaluate the biomechanical (kinematics and kinetics), neurophysiological (electromyography [EMG], brain plasticity, muscle physiology), and clinical effects of training with these devices. Specific populations of interest include individuals with Stroke, Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury, Amputations, and non-disabled individuals.
